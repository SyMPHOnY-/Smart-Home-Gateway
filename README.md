The main goal of this project is to create a demonstrator of smart home gateway which should merge the detection and forwarding of alarm systems&rsquo; events, local smart metering with other smart home services, sensors and actuators. The demonstrator should be able to run on OpenWRT-based standard IP home gateway (router) and on Linux Ubuntu-based device (e.g. netbook) as well. As the primary communication platform the state of the art and well recognized wireless and wired technologies like Wireless M-Bus, IEEE 802.11, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Ethernet, IMS, 3G/4G broadband, etc. are utilized.
