The main goal of SyMPHOnY (Smart Multi-Purpose Home Gateway) project is to create a demonstrator of smart home gateway which should merge the detection and forwarding of alarm systems&rsquo; events, local smart metering with other smart home services, sensors and actuators. 

The demonstrator is able to run on OpenWRT-based standard IP home gateway (router) and on Linux Ubuntu-based device (e.g. netbook) as well. As the primary communication platform wireless and wired technologies like Wireless M-Bus, IEEE 802.11, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Ethernet, IMS, 3G/4G broadband, etc. are utilized.
